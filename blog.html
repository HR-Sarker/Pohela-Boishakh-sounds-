    <h1>Pohela Boishakh</h1>
    <h2>This is a blog</h2>
   <p> We welcome the new Bangla year by singing Rabindranath Tagore's Boishakhi song to say goodbye to the old and create the dream of the new. In sweet faces, panta hilsa and new desi clothes, we become complete Bengalis for one day on this day. Pahela Baishakh and Panta Hilsa have become synonymous. The main attraction of Baishakhi Mela is now Panta Ilish. Again in the clay sunkey. Now many people are organizing this special meal in their own home. And for this reason, the price of hilsa is going out of the reach of the common people before the arrival of Baishakh. Pahela Baishakh is the day of the festival of Bengalis, the day of forgetting the old and embracing the new.</p>

The most colorful and joyful New Year is celebrated in Dhaka. Thousands of people gathered at Ramna's Batamul. The artists of Chhayanaut welcome the New Year by singing the arrival of Baishakh. A similar programme was held at Bakultala of the Institute of Fine Arts, University of Dhaka. All the teachers and students of the institute brought out a joyous procession on the university premises. The colorful procession of the artisans makes the call of the New Year eye-catching and deeply appealing. On this day, the entire university area including Shaheed Minar, TSC and Fine Arts turned into a huge crowd.</p>

<p>The names of the Bengali years come from the Shaka era (Shaka calendar) introduced in 78 AD to commemorate the Shaka dynasty. The months in Bengali are named after various constellations: from Vishakha to Baisakh, from Jyestha to Jaishtha, from Ashadha to Ashadha, from Shravana to Shravana, from Bhadrapada to Bhadra, from Krittika to Kartik, from Agrahayani to Agrahayan, from Pushya to Paush, from Magha to Magha, from Phalguni to Falgun, and from Chitra to Chaitra. Another explanation for the name of the month Agrahayan is: Agra means first, and Hayan means year or paddy. Previously, the year was counted starting from this month or the main crop of paddy was harvested during this time. Therefore, the name of this month is Agrahayan.</p>
